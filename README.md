# CovidStats

This is a project I gave myself over the 2021-22 winter break to learn python, and renforce the sql I learned. 

The program connects to my SQL database, and alows me to run SQL commands. 

WIP
In an attempt to streach myself I have begun some automation. THe program attempst so get uptodate data on covid-19 and add it to my database. I have been using selenium to automate getting the data, and Pandas to read the downloaded csv's. 

Future implementation 
Statisial analysis - currently only very basic anaysis is going on I will be implmenting somthing more intersting.
